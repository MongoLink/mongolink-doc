# Mongolink 

Mongolink is an object/document mapper for java and MongoDB. 
More informations can be found [here](http://mongolink.org)

## Purpose

We wanted to build a persistence tool that achieves several key features:

 * Persistence ignorance :Â our domain should not depend on abstractions coming from the persistence mechanism. Yes, an annotation on a an object is such a coupling
 * We don't want to use annotations, yet we don't want either to maintain tons of xml files 
 * Domain Driven Design is cool stuff, we wan't our persistence tool to understands concepts as aggregates, value objects, and entities
 * Concurrency with mongodb can be tricky. Updating the whole document when it's changed is clearly not a good strategy
